# 🧠 Cache Visualizer (LRU) – Web Interface

This project provides a web-based interface to visualize how a **Least Recently Used (LRU)** cache works. It allows users to interact with the cache operations and see real-time updates through a simple frontend interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, supported by a Python backend.

## 🚀 Features

- Interactive UI to simulate cache operations.
- Redis-based backend (assumed) to store cache values.
- Real-time visualization of insertion and eviction logic.
- Python-based server to initialize and connect the backend logic.

## 📁 Project Structure

```

```markdown
📦try2 - backup
├── index.html         # Main UI interface
├── main.js            # Handles user interaction logic
├── styles.css         # Stylesheet for the UI
├── init.py            # Initializes the backend (possibly Redis)
└── init-terminal.py   # Terminal-based utility for backend
```

````

## 🛠️ How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Redis server (if used)
- Web browser (Chrome/Firefox)

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cache-visualizer.git
   cd cache-visualizer
````

2. **Start the Backend:**

   ```bash
   python init.py
   ```

   Or use the terminal version:

   ```bash
   python init-terminal.py
   ```

3. **Open Frontend:**

   Simply open `index.html` in your browser.

## 💡 Use Case

This tool is ideal for:

* Learning how LRU cache works.
* Demonstrating cache eviction in real-time.
* Educational and academic purposes.
